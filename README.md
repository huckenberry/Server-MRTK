# Virtual Server Interaction for Immersive Learning in Hololens

A data center or data centre is a building, a dedicated space within a building, or a group of buildings used to house computer systems and associated components, such as telecommunications and storage systems. It is often not possible for students to visualize how servers in data center look like, or what the use of each component of a server is. This problem can be overcomed by the use of immersive technology in Hololens.

The Hololens is Microsoft's take on augmented reality, which they call “mixed reality”. Using multiple sensors, advanced optics, and holographic processing that melds seamlessly with its environment, These holograms can be used to display information, blend with the real world, or even simulate a virtual world.

In this immersive app, we have designed one server rack of a data center, containing firewall, switches, server boxes and other components. When user interacts with the components of the server, a voice also explains the use of each part.

This has been made using Microsoft's MRTK 2.8.
